# BicycleProject
A basic Symfony project to demonstrate code and Object-Oriented Principles.

With Symfony installed, you can run `symfony serve` in the directory to begin serving requests on localhost:8000.

The project will instantiate an object of class Bicycle, and respond to the request. 

## Project Details
The project took roughly three hours from start to completion. I used https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html to determine how to make a simple Symfony application.

I first made sure that the project could run and handle requests when started. Then I wrote a basic class `Bicycle`, with instances of class `Wheel` for the front and rear. `Bicycle` implements the interface `Rideable`.
